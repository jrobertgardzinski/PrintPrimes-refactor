# PrintPrimes refactore
The project goal is to refactor PrintPrimes.java function to Object Oriented program following uncle's Bob rules. I haven't focused neither on PrintPrimes.java code nor author's solution, except the idea of splitting it into three parts:

- PrimePrinter,
- RowColumnPagePrinter,
- PrimeGenerator,

I won't take no more inspiration from book, I promise. :)

I've got the code from Clean Code book, just like most of coders I suppose.
